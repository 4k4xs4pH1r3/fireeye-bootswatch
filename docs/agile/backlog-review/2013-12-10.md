### Discuss Ross's request to cache acquisition passwords.

### Discuss acquisition errors request.
- There are 5-10 of these errors per hour within the UAC logs.
- [27852](https://tp.mandiant.com/TargetProcess2/restui/tpview.aspx?acid=B2E5D5E30406CE90CBD2E567654B30BF#request/27852)

### Discuss Handling of Large Audits
- Should this be a design discussion for the afternoon?
- [27831](https://tp.mandiant.com/TargetProcess2/restui/tpview.aspx?acid=B2E5D5E30406CE90CBD2E567654B30BF#request/27831)

### Acquisition Data Required for UAC development in Devnet
- In order to do acquisitions development for UAC I need more data.  There is no longer a record in the dev Seasick
  that returns a file audit.
- Would it be useful to have an acquisition details view that display expands the information including host, comments,
  related errors, audit if available, issues document, etc?

### What to do with Wartell's requests?
- [27802](https://tp.mandiant.com/TargetProcess2/RestUI/TpView.aspx?acid=B2E5D5E30406CE90CBD2E567654B30BF#request/27802)
- [27803](https://tp.mandiant.com/TargetProcess2/Project/HelpDesk/Request/View.aspx?RequestID=27803)

### INFRA: Pre-compile Partial Templates
- We should pre-compile the client side templates for performance.  Also reduces the page footprint.
